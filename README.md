Web design for Brooks Waterburn

#Overview

Over the summer in 2015 I made 3 landing pages for a local insurance broker company (Brooks Waterburn Corp in Westbury, NY). 

This was my first major project with HTML/CSS, so I used Bootstrap to make things easier and prettier. The website was then written in Brackets, a new CSS/HTML editor created by Adobe.

A corresponding email campaign was made for each landing page. They were also made in Brackets. I then manually converted it to be mobile friendly after it was written. Unfortunately I never got around to making the actual websites mobile-friendly, but I was unsure if the website hosting program took care of that.
