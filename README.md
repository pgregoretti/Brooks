Web design for Brooks Waterburn

#Overview

Over the summer in 2015 I made 3 landing pages for a local insurance broker company (Brooks Waterburn Corp in Westbury, NY). 

This was my first major project with HTML/CSS, so I used Bootstrap to make things easier and prettier. Bootstrap is a popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework. The website was then written in Brackets, a new CSS/HTML editor created by Adobe. Basic JQuery was also incorporated.

A corresponding email campaign was made for each landing page. They were also made in Brackets. I then manually converted it to be mobile friendly after it was written. I was unable to get around to making the landing pages to be mobile-friendly.
